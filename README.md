#HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION
This project demonstrates the concept and implementation of Histogram Equalization, a key technique in image processing used to enhance the contrast of images. It is especially useful for images that are either too bright or too dark.
1.What is histogram equalization?
Histogram Equalization is a method in image processing that adjusts the contrast of an image by modifying the intensity distribution of the histogram. It works by spreading out the most frequent intensity values to better utilize the available dynamic range of pixel values.
#FEATURES
*Read and display grayscale images.
*Compute and plot original image histogram.
*Apply histogram equalization algorithm.
*Display equalized image and its histogram.
*Compare original and enhanced image visually and statistically.
#TECHNOLOGIES USED
*Python 3
*OpenCV (cv2)
*Matplotlib (for histogram plotting)
*NumPy (for pixel manipulation)
